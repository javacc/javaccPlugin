# JavaCC Compiler Plugin for Gradle

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/javacc/javaccPlugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/javacc/javaccPlugin/branches)

Provides the ability to use [JavaCC](http://javacc.java.net/) via [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/). If the 'java' plugin is also applied, JavaCompile tasks will depend upon the compileJavacc task.

## Installation

Simply grab the plugin from Maven Central:

To use the Gradle Plugins DSL, add the following lines to your `build.gradle` script:

```gradle
plugins {
  id "org.javacc.javacc" version "3.0.1"
}
```

Refer to the [Gradle Plugins portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/ca.coglinc.javacc) for additional details about the installation procedure, including syntax for the Kotlin DSL and the legacy `buildscript` block.

## Building from source

To build, simply run the following command in the directory where you checked out the plugin source:

`./gradlew clean build`

**NOTE:** Currently, the plugin must be built with Java 8. The plugin itself will build successfully with Java 9+, but a number of the tests will fail due to incompatibility with the Java 9+ module system.

## Usage

Place your JavaCC code into `src/main/javacc`.
The generated Java code will be  put under `./build/generated/javacc` and will be compiled as part of the Java compile.

Place your JJTree code into `src/main/jjtree`
The generated Java code will be  put under `./build/generated/jjtree` and will be compiled as part of the JavaCC compile.

You can configure the input/output directory by configuring the compileJavacc task:
```gradle
compileJavacc {
    inputDirectory = file('src/main/javacc')
    outputDirectory = file(project.buildDir.absolutePath + '/generated/javacc')
}
```
Due to the nature of the JavaCC compiler and its use of the OUTPUT_DIRECTORY parameter, you should prefer using `inputDirectory`Â over `source` provided by SourceTask. To use include/exclude filters, please refer to the [SourceTask](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.SourceTask.html) documentation. By default, only `*.jj` files are included.

You can configure commandline arguments passed to JavaCC by specifying `javaccArguments` map in compileJavacc:
```gradle
compileJavacc {
    arguments = [grammar_encoding: 'UTF-8', static: 'false']
}
```

Input/output directories and arguments can be configured as well for JJTree:
```gradle
compileJjtree {
    inputDirectory = file('src/main/jjtree')
    outputDirectory = file(project.buildDir.absolutePath + '/generated/jjtree')
    arguments = [grammar_encoding: 'UTF-8', static: 'false']
}
```

### Multiple source sets support

If your project uses multiple source sets, JavaCC output directory will by default become a dependency for all of them.
If you want to make it dependency only for selected source sets, you can do so with global plugin configuration

```
javacc {
    dependentSourceSets = [sourceSets.main]
}
```

### Eclipse

If you are using Eclipse and would like your gradle project to compile nicely in eclipse and have the generated code in the build path, you can simply add the generated path to the main sourceSet and add a dependency on `compileJavacc` to `eclipseClasspath`.
```gradle
sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDir compileJavacc.outputDirectory
        }
    }
}

eclipseClasspath.dependsOn("compileJavacc")
```

### Dependency on another version of JavaCC

If for some reason you need to depend on a different version of JavaCC than the plugin's default, you can use one of the following scripts.

For JavaCC up to 7.x:

```gradle
dependencies {
    javacc 'net.java.dev.javacc:javacc:[version]'
}
```

For JavaCC 8.x and later:
```gradle
dependencies {
    javacc 'org.javacc.generator:java:[version]'
}
```

### Custom AST classes

To use your own custom AST classes, simply place them in your JavaCC input directory besides your regular .jj files. Make sure to include .java files:
```
compileJavacc {
    include '**/*.java'
}
```

If you prefer, you can simply have them sit in your regular java source set. Of course, a custom AST class needs to be in the same package as the original AST class it overrides.

### JJDoc

The `jjdoc` task looks for JavaCC parser specifications in the default `src/main/javacc` directory and generates documentation into the default `./build/generated/jjdoc` directory.
Of course, you can provide arguments and configure the input/output directories as with the `compileJavacc` and `compileJjtree` tasks:
```gradle
jjdoc {
    inputDirectory = file('src/main/javacc')
    outputDirectory = file(project.buildDir.absolutePath + '/generated/jjdoc')
    arguments = [text: 'true']
}
```

## Compatibility

This plugin requires Java 8+.

It has been tested with Gradle 6.4+. Please let us know if you have had success with other versions of Gradle.

## Signature

The artifacts for this plugin are signed using the [PGP key](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x321163AE83A4068A) for `jonathan.martel@coglinc.ca`.

## Releasing

The following command can be used to release the project, upload to Maven Central and upload to Bintray:
```./gradlew -PreleaseVersion=[version] -PnextVersion=[snapshot version] -PscmUrl=https://github.com/javacc/javaccPlugin.git -PossrhUsername=[username] -PossrhPassword=[password] -PgpgPassphrase=[passphrase] -PbintrayUser=[username] -PbintrayApiKey=[apiKey] clean :release:release```
